# Keycloak Image

You need to [install Packer](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/packer/get-started-install-cli) to build this image.

Also, if you're running in your workstation, login to the GCP with application-default.

Run a `packer init .` and a `packer build .` (yes, there is a dot at the end of the command)
